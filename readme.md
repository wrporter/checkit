# Checkit

I started this project to learn a few things.

- How to securely do social login.
- How to securely manage user sessions.
- How to do the above and serve a single-page application (SPA) with a RESTful backend server.

## Tech

### UI

The UI is built in React, using Material UI for convenient styling and components.

### Backend

The server is written in Golang with MongoDB storage.

## TODO

- Switch from the now-insecure Implicit Grant Flow to the Authorization Code Flow for OpenID Connect.
